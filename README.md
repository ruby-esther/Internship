# Internship Project

This repository contains tasks completed during an internship focused on data analysis and machine learning using Python.

## üìÅ Tasks

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Basic Data Analysis
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- Key insights were drawn from:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Heatmaps

### ‚úÖ Task 2: House Price Prediction
- Built a **Linear Regression model** to predict housing prices
- Libraries used:
  - `scikit-learn` for model training, preprocessing, and evaluation
  - `pandas` for data handling
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Handled:
  - Null values
  - Categorical data (via one-hot encoding)
  - Outlier detection and removal
